GraphQL API built using Apollo Server + Typescript that integrates information about the urban mobility services of the city of Barcelona.

It provides information about bus stops and lines, metro stations/lines, and public bikes (Bicing) stations and availability.
## GraphQL Playground ðŸš€

## Usage ðŸ”§

### Install

The installation requires node.js as the execution environment as well as npm or yarn as the package manager. Then run `npm install` or `yarn install` as a command on your commandline interface.

### Run

To run it, execute `yarn build`, and then `yarn start`. The application will be available port `9000`.

### Generate Schema

To generate the schema and Typescript types for the schema (on `src/types.d.ts`), run `schema`. This uses [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)

### Test

In order to test using Jest, just run `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Data Sources ðŸ“Š

### Metro Stations / Bus Stops

For the metro stations and bus stops, we use the public `Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB)` API, at [https://developer.tmb.cat/](https://developer.tmb.cat/). 

The `App Key` and `App ID` are passed through the node's `process.env.TMB_API_APP_KEY` and `process.env.TMB_API_APP_ID` and the credentials can be obtained if you log and register an app to the portal.

### Bike Stations

For the bike stations, we use the [BSMSA](https://www.bsmsa.cat/es/) API for smou/bicing. The endpoints are:
